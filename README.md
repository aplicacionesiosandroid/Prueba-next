# NextJS E-commerce App with Zustand

This is a NextJS 14 app that demonstrates how to use Zustand for global state management. Zustand is a small, fast and scalable state management solution that uses React hooks. It allows you to create and access global stores from any component, and perform actions such as adding, removing, and updating items in the cart.

The app fetches product data from dummyjson and displays them in a grid layout using Tailwind CSS. Users can add products to the cart, view the cart details, and change the quantity or remove items from the cart. The app also shows the total price and number of items in the cart.
